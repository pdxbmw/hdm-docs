## About This Project

This documentation covers a web application designed to support hierarchical decision modeling research using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology. The application helps researchers conduct multi-criteria decision analysis by breaking down complex decisions into manageable parts, collecting expert judgments, and performing statistical analysis on the results.

## Documentation

Navigate through the sections using the sidebar to explore different aspects of the HDM application.

## Key Features

- **Model Builder** - Create hierarchical decision models with criteria, subcriteria, and alternatives
- **Expert Evaluation** - Collect pairwise comparison judgments from domain experts
- **AHP Calculations** - Automatic calculation of weights and consistency ratios
- **Statistical Analysis** - F-test analysis to validate expert agreement
- **Results Dashboard** - View aggregated results and individual expert evaluations

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Reflex (Python-based web framework)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLModel ORM
- **Authentication:** Clerk (passwordless authentication)
- **Deployment:** Docker containers on cloud platforms
